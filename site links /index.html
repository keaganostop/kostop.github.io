       <p> Welcome to my website! My name is Keagan Ostop, I am a sophomore journalism major at Fordham University. During my third semester at Fordham I took a Digital Technology and New Media course at Lincoln Center with professor Hamidreza Nassiri. In this course I had the opportunity to produce a short documentary, a portfolio of photographs, and this website to document all I have accomplished. </p>
