      <h3> <a href="https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=L5Qc2ZzsUi0"> Maria Sola Green Space Documentary</a> </h3>
      <p> For my Digital Technology and New Media course at Fordham University Lincoln Center, I created a documentary about the Maria Sola Green Space. This is a growing community garden in Mott Haven Bronx, New York. It is becoming a space for community members to gather and garden. This beautiful greenspace also serves as a place for children to play. This is extremely valuable since in New York City the opportunity to connect with nature is limited. The space developed during the pandemic and everyday more and more community members are getting involved. This space is accepting and welcomes all people. The members of the community garden come together to personally take care of the garden and find ways in which the community can be better. In my documentary I volunteered for one day at the garden where I got to truly emerge myself in the wonderful Maria Sola Green Space. I spoke with members of the community to learn about the history of the greenspace and what hopes they have for the garden in the future. I had the wonderful opportunity to get to know a few members of the community and the role they have played in creating this oasis in the most populated city in the United States. Watch my documentary to learn more.
